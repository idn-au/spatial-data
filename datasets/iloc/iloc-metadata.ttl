    dcterms:description """This is a reference geospatial dataset developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which provides the most granular form of Indigenous Structure represented in the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS), currently at Edition 3 (2021).  Indigenous Locations (ILOCs) are designed to allow the production and analysis of statistics relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with a high level of spatial accuracy, while also maintaining the confidentiality of individuals. It has been designed in consultation with the ABS Centre for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Statistics to incorporate statistical and community requirements wherever possible.

ILOCs are geographic areas built from whole Statistical Areas Level 1 (SA1s). They are designed to represent small Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities (urban and rural) that are near each other or that share language, traditional borders or Native Title. They usually have a minimum population of about 90 people. In some cases, Indigenous Locations have a smaller Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population to meet statistical requirements or to better represent the local community.

Where a community is too small for confidentiality requirements, it is combined with another, related population. Remaining Statistical Areas Level 1 are combined into larger areas, which will include a more dispersed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population.

In some cases, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities that are too small to be identified separately have been combined with other nearby and associated communities. This has resulted in some multi-part Indigenous Locations where related communities are represented as a single Indigenous Location but are geographically separate. This enables the release of Census of Population and Housing data and other data for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in a meaningful way, while balancing confidentiality and statistical requirements.

There are 1,139 ILOCs covering the whole of Australia without gaps or overlaps. Whole ILOCs aggregate to form Indigenous Areas (IAREs). Whole Indigenous Areas aggregate to form Indigenous Regions (IREGs).

Indigenous Locations are identified by eight-digit hierarchical codes consisting of a one-digit State or Territory identifier, followed by a two-digit Indigenous Region identifier, a three-digit Indigenous Area identifier and finally a two-digit Indigenous Location identifier. Within each Indigenous Area, Indigenous Location identifiers are unique. When change occurs, old codes are retired and the next available identifier is assigned.

Shapefiles for Indigenous Locations and other components of the ABS's Indigenous Structure are available: https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs-edition-3/jul2021-jun2026/access-and-downloads/digital-boundary-files
