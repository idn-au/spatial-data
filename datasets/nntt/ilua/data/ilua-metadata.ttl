The Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements is kept by the Native Title Registrar in accordance with s 199A of the NTA and includes a description of the ILUA area, the parties' names, the term of the ILUA and other information as the Registrar considers is appropriate (s 199B of the NTA). Registration confers a contractual effect on the ILUA and binds all persons holding native title regardless as to whether they are already parties to the ILUA (s 24EA of the NTA). Note: This dataset contains records of ILUAs that have been publicly notified and/or registered."@en ;
