A "determination of native title" is a decision on whether native title exists in relation to a particular area of land or waters (s 225 of the NTA). Determinations of native title can be made by agreement (consent determination), without opposition (unopposed determination) or following a trial (litigated determination). An "approved determination of native title" is a determination of native title made by the Federal Court of Australia, the High Court of Australia, or a recognised State/Territory body within its jurisdictional limits (s 13 of the NTA). Only approved determinations of native title are recorded on the National Native Title Register (s 193 of the NTA). Note: This dataset also includes representations of determinations of native title that have not yet been entered on the National Native Title Register."@en ;
